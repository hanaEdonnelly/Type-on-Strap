Our mission at Carolina Womenâ€™s Club Ice Hockey is to foster an inclusive and welcoming community where women of all skill levels come together to play hockey. Through our organization, we aim to break down barriers, promote inclusivity, and ensure a welcoming and fun atmosphere on the ice. Our members are dedicated to creating a fun and supporting atmosphere encouraging teamwork, friendship, and love of the game.

USC Women's Hockey was founded in 2022, playing our first season during the 2023-2024 academic year. 

We are members of <a href="https://www.collegehockeysouth.com/">College Hockey South (CHS)</a> who is governed by the <a href="https://www.aaucollegehockey.org/">Amateur Athletic Union (AAU)</a>. 

As a student-run organization, our club sport operates independently and does not receive funding comparable to that of NCAA sports such as football. We rely significantly on community support and contributions to support our team.

Thank you to all of our supporters for helping us keep our team going.

<b>Go Gamecocks!</b>
